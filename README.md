A little bit of theory
I won’t spend much time writing about the economics theory for inflation and its consequences, as this is a topic for a much longer article with a different focus. To define inflation in one sentence — it is the general rise in the price level of an economy over a period of time. It means that when the general price level rises, with each unit of currency (be it dollars, euros, etc.) we can buy fewer units of certain goods or services. And that is the reduction in the purchasing power of money that was mentioned before.

We measure inflation with the inflation rate, which is the annualized percentage change in a general price index, most commonly the consumer price index (CPI).

We need to define two more terms that will make the analysis easy to follow. The first one is current dollars. It refers to the value from the time period when the monetary value was actually registered. Or alternatively, it is the value not adjusted for inflation. The second term is the real dollars, that is, the value after adjusting for inflation.

The general formula used for adjusting the prices for inflation using the CPI is:

real_dollars = (current_dollars * cpi_new) / cpi_old
